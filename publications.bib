	abstract = {Network-based technologies such as cloud computing, web services, and Internet of Things systems are becoming widely used due to their flexibility and preeminence. On the other hand, the exponential proliferation of network-based technologies exacerbated network security concerns. Intrusion takes an important share in the security concerns surrounding network-based technologies. Developing a robust intrusion detection system is crucial to solving the intrusion problem and ensuring the secure delivery of network-based technologies and services. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to detect intrusions to make network applications more secure, reliable, and efficient. As for the reinforcement learning approach, Deep Q-learning is used alongside a custom-built Gym environment that mimics network attacks and guides the learning process. The NSL-KDD dataset is used to create the reinforcement learning environment to train and evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results show that our proposed reinforcement learning approach outperforms other related solutions in the literature, achieving an accuracy that exceeds 93\%.},

	abstract = {In a Technological financial world where everything is progressing very fast and the amount of financial transactions through the automatic teller machines (ATM) on a daily basis is increasing. In parallel to these developments, fraudulent attacks and identity theft targeting to access the ATM and steal money or use bank accounts. Those attacks are always possible through the weak security points in the ATMs. The main aim of this study is to investigate and categorize the different approaches taken to overcome those weak security points by using biometric data along with some traditional methods. Accordingly, a systematical mapping was conducted by focusing on research studies published in the years 2004 to 2019 and addressing to the ATMs and biometric security technologies. After an intense investigation, 23 different systems were investigated using different single and multi-biometric models which make use of 8 different biometric technologies and 5 different traditional technologies as key components. As a conclusion from this research that researchers are leaning towards using biometric data in enhancing the security of the ATMs especially in the past 4 years more than they did before.},

	abstract = {Human gait analysis has been one of the primary procedures for diagnosis in modern healthcare applications for various diseases. Instead of using expensive wearable sensors on patients, this research aims to assist in gait analysis and classification for medical diagnoses using computer vision solely. A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network based on MediaPipe Pose for video-based human gait analysis is proposed to assist in diagnosing patients with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly cerebellar ataxia. The kinematic parameters were extracted from the pose estimation model on captured gait videos before deriving the spatiotemporal parameters for quantitative gait analysis. Data augmentation is applied to increase dataset size, and five-fold cross-validation is performed to verify the suitability of the developed dataset for training deep neural networks. The selected LSTM model achieves a testing accuracy of 99.8\% with very high precision and recall metrics for ataxic and normal gait classes. The proposed methodology can be applied in broader applications for remote rehabilitation and patient monitoring. Clinical Relevance-The developed system can assist physicians in diagnosing cerebellar ataxic patients and monitoring gait rehabilitation process remotely via camera vision.},

	abstract = {Guarding the cyberinfrastructure is critical to ensure the proper transmission and availability of computer network services, information, and data. The proliferation in the number of cyber attacks launched on the cyberinfrastructure by making data unprocurable and network services inaccessible is on the rise. Botnets are considered one of the most sophisticated cybersecurity threats to the cyberinfrastructure and are becoming more daunting with time. Developing an efficient and robust botnet detection technique is a priority to ensure the security and reachability of the cyberinfrastructure. In this research, we introduce a solution and explore the use of a novel neural network architecture leveraging a graph-based learning approach, namely Graph Neural Network (GNN) for botnet detection. GNN was used to benefit from the unique architecture of botnets and to omit the feature engineering step of the machine learning pipeline as it is a costly and cumbersome process. Additionally, we report the effectiveness of different GNN variations in terms of detecting botnets to get an insight into the performance of each model. The ISCX-Bot-2014 dataset was used to create a graph data object for the training and testing of our proposed approach. The results show our proposed GNN solution’s ability to generalize to unseen botnets and perform better compared to other relevant work from the literature with an accuracy that exceeds 94\%.},
