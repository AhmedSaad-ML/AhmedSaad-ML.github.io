abstract: Guarding the cyberinfrastructure is critical to ensure the proper transmission
  and availability of computer network services, information, and data. The proliferation
  in the number of cyber attacks launched on the cyberinfrastructure by making data
  unprocurable and network services inaccessible is on the rise. Botnets are considered
  one of the most sophisticated cybersecurity threats to the cyberinfrastructure and
  are becoming more daunting with time. Developing an efficient and robust botnet
  detection technique is a priority to ensure the security and reachability of the
  cyberinfrastructure. In this research, we introduce a solution and explore the use
  of a novel neural network architecture leveraging a graph-based learning approach,
  namely Graph Neural Network (GNN) for botnet detection. GNN was used to benefit
  from the unique architecture of botnets and to omit the feature engineering step
  of the machine learning pipeline as it is a costly and cumbersome process. Additionally,
  we report the effectiveness of different GNN variations in terms of detecting botnets
  to get an insight into the performance of each model. The ISCX-Bot-2014 dataset
  was used to create a graph data object for the training and testing of our proposed
  approach. The results show our proposed GNN solution’s ability to generalize to
  unseen botnets and perform better compared to other relevant work from the literature
  with an accuracy that exceeds 94%.
