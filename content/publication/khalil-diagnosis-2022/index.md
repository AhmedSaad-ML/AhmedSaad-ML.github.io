abstract: Human gait analysis has been one of the primary procedures for diagnosis
  in modern healthcare applications for various diseases. Instead of using expensive
  wearable sensors on patients, this research aims to assist in gait analysis and
  classification for medical diagnoses using computer vision solely. A long short-term
  memory (LSTM) neural network based on MediaPipe Pose for video-based human gait
  analysis is proposed to assist in diagnosing patients with neurodegenerative diseases,
  particularly cerebellar ataxia. The kinematic parameters were extracted from the
  pose estimation model on captured gait videos before deriving the spatiotemporal
  parameters for quantitative gait analysis. Data augmentation is applied to increase
  dataset size, and five-fold cross-validation is performed to verify the suitability
  of the developed dataset for training deep neural networks. The selected LSTM model
  achieves a testing accuracy of 99.8% with very high precision and recall metrics
  for ataxic and normal gait classes. The proposed methodology can be applied in broader
  applications for remote rehabilitation and patient monitoring. Clinical Relevance-The
  developed system can assist physicians in diagnosing cerebellar ataxic patients
  and monitoring gait rehabilitation process remotely via camera vision.
