 abstract = {In a Technological financial world where everything is progressing very fast and the amount of financial transactions through the automatic teller machines (ATM) on a daily basis is increasing. In parallel to these developments, fraudulent attacks and identity theft targeting to access the ATM and steal money or use bank accounts. Those attacks are always possible through the weak security points in the ATMs. The main aim of this study is to investigate and categorize the different approaches taken to overcome those weak security points by using biometric data along with some traditional methods. Accordingly, a systematical mapping was conducted by focusing on research studies published in the years 2004 to 2019 and addressing to the ATMs and biometric security technologies. After an intense investigation, 23 different systems were investigated using different single and multi-biometric models which make use of 8 different biometric technologies and 5 different traditional technologies as key components. As a conclusion from this research that researchers are leaning towards using biometric data in enhancing the security of the ATMs especially in the past 4 years more than they did before.},
