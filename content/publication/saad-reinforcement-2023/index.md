abstract: Network-based technologies such as cloud computing, web services, and Internet
  of Things systems are becoming widely used due to their flexibility and preeminence.
  On the other hand, the exponential proliferation of network-based technologies exacerbated
  network security concerns. Intrusion takes an important share in the security concerns
  surrounding network-based technologies. Developing a robust intrusion detection
  system is crucial to solving the intrusion problem and ensuring the secure delivery
  of network-based technologies and services. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
  using deep reinforcement learning to detect intrusions to make network applications
  more secure, reliable, and efficient. As for the reinforcement learning approach,
  Deep Q-learning is used alongside a custom-built Gym environment that mimics network
  attacks and guides the learning process. The NSL-KDD dataset is used to create the
  reinforcement learning environment to train and evaluate the proposed model. The
  experimental results show that our proposed reinforcement learning approach outperforms
  other related solutions in the literature, achieving an accuracy that exceeds 93%.
